JavaScript Modul Final Project

-----------------------------------------
Project Name: "TamaYoshi" --> an Tamagotchi like game (just with a fat cat as your pet ;)
-----------------------------------------

### **Pet Needs**
##The 4 main needs are 
1. Hungry
2. Thirsty
3. Healthiness / Sickness
4. Happiness

Explanation:
You will Start with a set of Stats for each of the 4 needs. At the beginning every need on def                                                                              

**1. Hungry: Feed your Pet with several foods**
  0000000000000000000000000000000,,0000
Feed with:

- Usual Cat food from the Supermarket  ("are you Kidding me?")
- Tuna ("that makes me full, but not satisfied")     
- Lasagne ("let's do the Garfield way, you may kiss the paw now")
=> Hungry:      -50;
=> Happy:       +50;
=> Healthy:     -70;

**Thirsty: Give your pet water, milk or even finer things to drink**

Feed with:
- water ("Go away with the cheap booze.....but thanks loyal human")
=> Healthy:     +50;
=> Hungry:      -50;
=> Happy:       -70;

- delicious milk ("uhh mewow")
- Prosecco ("just a little dropplet for my royal paw") 

**Sickness: heal your pet**

Heal with:
- stroke the belly ("purr purr....purr it's better now")
- massage your pet ("yeahh...this point in the neck, yeahh exactly")
- stroking the head (purr purr....don't stop")
- kiss the paw ("but was also time for this my loyal human")

**Happines: play with....or even better, play for your cat, to amuse him**

Amuse with:
- dance for your cat ("dance little monkey...dance!")
- throw a ball ("do i look like i'm running after it? Run yourself, I am royalty and this is beneath me.")
- play with the laserpointer ("I'd be chasing the dot if you hadn't cheesed me so fat")
- turn on the TV and give him the remote control ("Finally I can continue watching "How to sell drugs online (fast)". Be quite little human")
------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What has to be programmed to realize the Project?**
- a class to create your own cat. 
--> the result is, you can't create your own cat, Yoshi decides who he is and how he looks. We are  not on a "Wishconcert" ;)
- Queries (Abfragen) with prompt to get in the pet properties
- a countdown to see when the pet is hungry, thirsty, sick, or bored.
