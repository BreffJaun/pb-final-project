# "tamaYOSHI"

A BRANDNEW RETRO GAME by BreffJaun, itzFlorian and grossesbewirken.
Dedicated to Jeffs Cat called Yoshi and the old Tamagotchi-Game.
Just pure JavaScript, a clear Terminal and joy of games from 1997.
But more Yoshi than Tamagotchi as you might think off.

## How to install:

1. Clone this repo with THIS ssh-key => "git clone git@github.com:BreffJaun/pb-final-project.git"
2. Install npm-package (if necessary) =>  "npm install"
3. Install npm packages promp-sync and chalk => "npm install prompt-sync chalk"
4. Start the game on your terminal => "node index.js"
5. Enjoy the life of a 24/7 cat servant!

## How to play:

"tamaYOSHI" is the javascript version of owning a cat, what basically means, to be the servant of a cat.
And Yoshis is the "Highness" of all cats. So be prepared for "Your Highnesses high standards".
That´s why tamaYOSHI has THREE game modes:
   **FOOTMAN** (easy): for beginners, means, people who haven´t hat a cat before
   **VALET** (normal): for those, who think they know cats.
   **BUTLER** (hard): for those, who never met Yoshi before. 

#### FOOD: 
Finest Tuna - Cat Food - Lasagne
#### DRINK: 
Just Pure Water - Cool Fresh Milk - Nice Champagne
#### MOOD:
Turn on the TV! - Dance for me! - Stroke my Belly!

#### HEALTH:
All your decisions will effect YOSHIs health. If you don´t fullfill all his needs, you´ll be fired.

## How we made it**
We are all DCI students since March 2022. We will become web developer and started JavaScript 2 month ago.
This is our final modul project. That´s why you just have a terminal instead of fancy stuff. For fancy stuff visit our younger repos.
